## üîÑ Retrieve Saved Signature

The **Retrieve Saved Signature** feature works as follows:
1. Draw your signature on the canvas and save it.
2. Once saved, the signature is stored in the browser's **localStorage**.
3. After refreshing the page, your saved signature will be automatically retrieved and displayed on the canvas.
   - The feature restores the canvas with the last saved signature without requiring any additional user interaction.
4. If you want to clear the saved signature, click the "Clear" button. This will remove it from both the canvas and the localStorage.

**Important Notes**:
- This feature is only available as long as the browser's **localStorage** remains intact.
- The saved signature is automatically restored on page reload.
- Use the "Clear" button to delete the saved signature from both the canvas and the storage.
